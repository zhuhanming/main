== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]
// end::architecture[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

// tag::ui[]
[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFilter`, `RightPanel` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `ListPanel` is located at the left of the application and it consists of UI `EventCard`, `ModuleCard`, `TitleCard` to display list of events or modules.
The `RightPanel` is located at the right of the application and it consists of UI `RightPanelDeadlineCard` ,
`RightPanelDescription`, and `RightPanelEventCard` to display the details of the module or event.

For example, user can do `view` command to view the deadlines of the event in the `ListPanel` and the details and deadlines of the event will be displayed on the `RightPanel`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in
link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
// end::ui[]

// tag::logic[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `ModuloParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an event).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

==== *StatefulLogic* Interface:

`StatefulLogic` is implemented by classes that only manages logic while a state exists.
This state would be loaded from special `CommandResult` subclasses, and allows this `StatefulLogicManager` to take priority over the default `LogicManager`.
The exact implementation of state is up to the developer. +

Currently, there is only one class that implements it: `AddModuleStatefulLogicManager`.
Its state is loaded from a special `AddModuleCommandResult` created by the `AddModuleCommand`, i.e. when the user uses the
`module m/MODULE_CODE` command.

The state is created using a list of the event types (tutorial, lecture, lab etc.) that the added module has.
Subsequently, while the list is not empty, the `AddModuleStatefulLogicManager` handles all inputs, thus allowing Modulo to add the relevant events.

More details on the implementation can be found <<StatefulLogic,here>>.

==== *Writer* Component:

The Writer component is activated when the `ExportCommand` is executed.
It then calls the `writeIcsFile()` function from the `IcsWriter` class which retrieves the current list of events from the `Model` component which, along with its deadlines, are converted into `IcsEvent` and `IcsDeadline` objects, which are then written into the ICS file.

==== Sample Interactions

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
// end::logic[]

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores Modulo data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As of now, there are two separate `ObservableList` being maintained, and with each individual module keeping its own list of events as well.
In the future, to better enable the concept of a single source of truth, we can discard the use of a
`ObservableList<Event>` and expose solely the unmodifiable `ObservableList<Module>`, and have events accessed through its parent module. +

image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Alternatively, we can remove the list of events under each module and instead just maintain the two separate
`UniqueModuleList` and `UniqueEventList`.
This may, however, make it costly to render the module list, since we now need to search through the entire list of events to find relevant ones.
// end::model[]

// tag::storage[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/modulo/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Modulo data in json format and read it back.
// end::storage[]

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `modulo.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::statefullogic[]
[[StatefulLogic]]
=== Stateful Logic Feature

Multistep commands are facilitated by `StatefulLogic`.
It is an interface with three methods exposed, and currently only has one class implementing it,
`AddModuleStatefulLogicManager`.

.Structure of the Stateful Logic Component
image::StatefulLogicClassDiagram.png[]

Let us understand how `StatefulLogic` works.

==== How `StatefulLogic` works

As long as a `StatefulLogicManager`, which is a class that implements `StatefulLogic`, has state, it will take over the `LogicManager` in executing the given `String`.

.The current implementation
image::AddModuleHasStateSequenceDiagram.png[]

Should there be more `StatefulLogicManager` instances in play, we will see something like this:

.If more Stateful Logic Managers are added
image::MultipleHasStateSequenceDiagram.png[]

At any point of time, only one `StatefulLogicManager` will have state.
The `LogicManager` will thus check through them one by one, and will only directly parse the command itself should no `StatefulLogicManager` have state.
We can think of these `StatefulLogicManager` as "consumers" that consume the input if it has state.

The abstraction of how these `StatefulLogicManager` execute the given `String` helps to maintain the *Single Responsibility Principle*.
The interaction between the `LogicManager` and `StatefulLogicManager` is also facilitated through the interface,
`StatefulLogic`, which upholds the *Dependency Inversion Principle*.

==== How state is loaded and maintained

State is loaded into `StatefulLogicManager` using special `CommandResult` subclasses.
In the instance of the
`AddModuleStatefulLogicManager`, its state is loaded by passing a `AddModuleCommandResult` into its
`loadStateFromCommandResult` method.

Let us take a look at the full process, using `AddModuleCommand` as an example:

.Executing the `module m/CS2103` command
image::AddModuleOverviewSequenceDiagram.png[]

There is no difference for the first part from a regular `Command` execution.
The differences lie in the state preparation and state loading.

.State Preparation for `AddModuleCommandResult`
image::StatePreparationSequenceDiagram.png[]

The state is prepared during the initialising command, and that command will pack that state into a special subclass of `CommandResult`.
This `CommandResult` is then passed back to the default `LogicManager`.

State loading is then done, if suitable.

.State Loading for `AddModuleStatefulLogicManager`
image::StateLoadingSequenceDiagram.png[]

The `eventList` is passed on to the `AddModuleStatefulLogicManager` to be used as state.
As long as the list is not empty, it is considered to have state.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `StatefulLogic` should be positioned with respect to `Logic`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have `StatefulLogic` exist as a sub-logic-circuit within `Logic` that activates when conditions are met.
** Pros: Reduce repeated code (*DRY*) and adheres to the *Open Closed Principle*, since the use of a simple interface makes it easy to create future `StatefulLogic` classes and integrate them.
** Cons: `Logic` now has to take care of checking for state prior to execution of command, as well as follow up on special subclasses of `CommandResult`, thus violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
* **Alternative 2:** Have `StatefulLogic` extend `Logic` and have a separate `LogicDispatcher` class that decides which `Logic` to dispatch the command to.
** Pros: Seems to follow the Single Responsibility Principle better.
** Cons: A lot of repeated code, and to some extent, this may be an adaptation of the current implementation, where the
`Logic` class acts as the `LogicDispatcher`.
Furthermore, it may not be correct to say that `Logic` and `StatefulLogic` are similar.
`StatefulLogic` does operate quite differently from `Logic`.

* **Future Extension:** It may be worth looking into this and find a better way to handle this logic without breaking the existing Command Pattern.
There may be more similarities that can be abstracted out and maximised using OOP.

===== Aspect: How multistep commands should be implemented and achieved

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `StatefulLogic` to keep relevant states and logic together.
** Pros: Uses OOP to reduce complexity.
Adheres to the *Open Closed Principle*, since each class can just implement
`StatefulLogic`, and the exact management of its state is open.
** Cons: `Logic` now needs to handle the pre and post-command logic.
* **Alternative 2:** Maintain a global state that `Logic` listens to when executing commands.
** Pros: All commands can push state to this global state without having to go through `Logic`, reducing the pre and post-command handling.
** Cons: The implementation of this global state will be highly complex, since the logic required for different states is different as well. `Logic` would be overwhelmed.
If a new type of state is required, the changes required will be heavy as well, thus violating the Open Closed Principle.
// end::statefullogic[]

// tag::done[]
=== Done Feature

This feature allows the User to set the deadline's status to be completed or not completed.
The user input is handled and retrieved by the `MainWindow` class in the Ui component first, before being passed to the `LogicManager` to execute.
First,`LogicManager` will call `ModuloParser`, which will parse the input to give a `DoneCommandParser`.
Then, `DoneCommandParser` will return a `DoneCommand`, which will help to set the status of deadline and update the
`Model`.
Invalid inputs such as an invalid index (e.g. `done 1000`) are also handled properly, with suitable error messages being displayed to the user.
The `DoneCommand` is implemented according to the operation in the `Logic` module:

* `DoneCommand` -- Sets the status of the deadline.

For the command, a `DoneCommandParser` is implemented to parse the input into the required index.

* `DoneCommandParser` -- Parses the `done` command input and generates a `DoneCommand`.

Given below is a sequence diagram to show how the `done` mechanism behaves at each step.

image::Done_SequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is an activity diagram to show how the `done` operation works.

image::Done_ActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `done` is executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can `done` one deadline at a time.
** Pros: Easy to implement and not likely to create bugs.
** Cons: More steps are required for the user if they wish to complete different deadlines.

* **Alternative 2 :** User can `done` multiple deadlines at a time.
** Pros: Less time-consuming than if the user were to complete a list of deadlines, one at a time.
** Cons: User input will be highly complex, as we may need to consider the different use cases, e.g. deadlines of different events, of different modules etc.
We will be required to check and account for various possibilities before the operation can be done.
Difficult to implement, and even harder to troubleshoot if bugs occur.

===== Other considerations

* Modulo will keep track of all the deadlines' statuses and send reminders to the user accordingly.
** Pros: A good feature that helps to remind users of their incomplete deadlines.
** Cons: Hard to implement and it increases coupling.
Difficult to write test cases as well.

* **Future Extension:** Modulo can have another UI panel to display every deadline that needs to be done a certain week.
The user can then use the `done` command to update the deadlines' statuses from there.
// end::done[]

// tag::export[]
[[Export]]
=== Export Feature

Modulo supports exporting user's calendar to .ics file format to facilitate data transfer between different scheduling platforms.

By using a simple `FileWriter` class and generating the .ics entities, we're able to generate an .ics file that can be consumed by commonly used platforms (e.g. Google Calendar)

An overview of the process is shown as below through the triggering of ExportCommand:

image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `Deadline` should be exported together with `Event`

Event entities can be mapped to VEVENT .ics type, but there is a lack of suitable counterparts for deadline.

* **Alternative 1: ** Export `Deadline` as VTODO
** Pros: Deadline has its standalone VTODO .ics item type.
** Cons: Some popular calendar applications do not support VTODO importing, thus making users lose out on important information regarding events.

* **Alternative 2:** Export `Deadline` within the description of each `Event`
** Pros: Users are able to see at a glance what are the `Deadline` for each `Event` easily
** Cons: Users are unable to take advantage of VTODO import functionality of certain calendar application.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Combine both options
Users are able to make full use of .ics importing capabilities, while also providing a quick overview of `Deadline`
// end::export[]

// tag::delete[]
=== Module / Event / Deadline Deletion Feature

This Deletion feature allows the user to delete modules, events or deadlines.
The user input is first retrieved by the `MainWindow` class which is then passed to the `LogicManager` via the `execute`
function.
`LogicManager` will call the `parseCommand` function of ModuloParser`, which will parse the input to create a temporary `DeleteCommandParser` object,
 parsing the input and returning a `DeleteCommand`.
The command will then be executed in the `LogicManager`, returning a `CommandResult` object which will then be returned as
feedback to the user.


Given below is a sequence diagram to show how the `delete` feature parsing an input of '1' behaves at each step:

image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is an activity diagram to show how the `delete` operation works.

image::DeleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How `delete` may be executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can delete multiple items using the command at the same time.
** Pros: Allows the user more flexibility in deleting modules and events instead of just deleting them one
by one. For example users can choose to delete one, many or even all modules and events, depending on
their command input.
** Cons: This has caused the code to become more complex in dealing with the many possible inputs
and scenarios, leading to a higher amount of potential errors.

[NOTE]
With respect to deadlines, users can only delete one or all deadlines of a particular event. This
is to avoid any confusion and unnecessary complexity which may be caused by deleting deadlines across
all events, especially since the user may only observe deadlines of one event at any one time and do
not have access to the overall list of deadlines.


* **Alternative 2 :** User can `delete` only one or all items.
** Pros: Reduces the lack of potential errors due to the decreased complexity of the code.
** Cons: It is less intuitive for the user as users are now limited by deleting one or all the events /
 modules / deadlines.


* **Future Extension:** Modulo can have another UI panel to display every deadline that needs to be done a certain week.
The user can then use the `delete` command to delete multiple deadlines at one go, making it more convenient
for the user.
// end::delete[]

// tag::edit[]
=== [Proposed] Edit Feature

Currently, Modulo does not allow for the editing of the details of events and deadlines that have been created.

==== Proposed Implementation

// end::edit[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo Feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModulo`.
It extends `Modulo` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `moduloStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModulo#commit()` -- Saves the current modulo state in its history.
* `VersionedModulo#undo()` -- Restores the previous modulo state from its history.
* `VersionedModulo#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone modulo state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModulo()`, `Model#undoModulo()` and
`Model#redoModulo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, toggles to the event list and views an event.
The `VersionedModulo` will be initialized with the initial modulo state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single modulo state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th event in Modulo.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitModulo()`, causing the modified state of Modulo after the `delete 5`
command executes to be saved in the `moduloStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Modulo state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `deadline n/Draw UML` to add a new deadline to the viewed event.
The `deadline` command also calls `Model#commitModulo()`, causing another modified modulo state to be saved into the `moduloStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitModulo()`, so the Modulo state will not be saved into the `moduloStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the deadline was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModulo()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Modulo state, and restores Modulo to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Modulo state, then there are no previous Modulo states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoModulo()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoModulo()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Modulo to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `moduloStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Modulo state, then there are no undone Modulo states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModulo()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list modules`.
Commands that do not modify Modulo, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitModulo()`,
`Model#undoModulo()` or `Model#redoModulo()`.
Thus, the `moduloStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitModulo()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `moduloStateList`, all modulo states after the
`currentStatePointer` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `deadline n/Draw UML` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire Modulo.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the deadline being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of Modulo states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice.
For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedModulo`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands.
Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::logging[]
=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
// end::logging[]

// tag::configuration[]

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with no data. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

. Shutting down

.. Launch the help window by typing `help`.
.. Quit the app by typing `exit`. +
Expected: Both the main window and the help window should close.

=== Deleting a module

. Deleting a module using index while all modules are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all modules using the `list modules` command. Multiple modules in the list.
.. Test case: `delete 1` +
Expected: First module is deleted from the list.
All events of that module are deleted.
Details of the deleted module shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `delete 0` +
Expected: No module is deleted.
No events deleted.
Error details shown in the status message.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size). +
Expected: Similar to previous.

. Deleting a module using search terms while all modules are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all modules using the `list modules` command. CS2103 in the list. Other CS modules in the
list.
.. Test case: `delete CS2103` +
Expected: CS2103 is deleted from the list.
Details of the deleted module shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `delete cs` +
Expected: All CS modules are deleted.
Number of deleted modules shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `delete cs2199` +
Expected: No module is deleted.
Information shown in the status message.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete x` (where x is a term that does not exist in the list). +
Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Corrupt the current save file under `./data/`. The easiest way is to type `-` somewhere in one of the saved
modules' academic year.
Another way may be to add random characters that make the JSON format unreadable.
.. Double-click the jar file +
Expected: Shows the GUI with no data.

.. Delete the current save file under `./data/`.
.. Double-click the jar file +
Expected: Shows the GUI with no data.

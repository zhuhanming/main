Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process\nRedesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times.\nSeveral BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an \u201cAs-Is\u201d and \u201cTo-Be\u201d model.\n\nThis course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions.
